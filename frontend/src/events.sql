4	Guys and Dolls 	Markay Gallery brings something for everyone during the month of Father’s Day. Their First Friday show titled “Guys & Dolls” features a blend of feminine and masculine styled art.   In the Upper Gallery:  Fairhope, Alabama artist, Kelley Ogburn debuts her soft palette and fluid style blending illustrative lines with a loose, painterly brush. Kelley captures the anticipation of ballerina’s behind the curtain, the quietness of peaceful solitude with her figure work and the softness of flower petals with her flora paintings. Kelley’s work will be enjoyed with an artful wine pairing.   In the Lower Gallery: A more masculine feel resonates in the lower gallery. Artwork perfect for any “Man Cave” takes centerstage. From pub tables encased in tools and gears to paintings in darker hues, artists share work meant to convey a rough and rugged feel. Buckets of beer will be chilled and ready for happy hour on this fun night.
